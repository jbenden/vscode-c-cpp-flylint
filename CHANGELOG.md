## [1.9.0] - 2021-03-20

### Changed

- Configuring settings allows users to conveniently select a different
  set of tools based on project's need, but also allows attackers to
  run arbitrary binaries on your machine, if they successfully
  convince you to open a random repository.

  To reduce the security risk, you may mark a workspace as a trusted
  workspace.

  CVE-2021-28953

## [1.8.2] - 2021-02-24

### Changed

- Fix non-fatal error about diagnostic code was neither a number nor

### Changed

- Cppcheck severity maps weren't ideal. Fixes #110.

## [0.5.3] - 2017-11-11

  Fixes #22.

## [0.5.1] - 2017-10-20

### Changed

- Minor change to the way command executions are shown, to enable easier
  copy and paste to a terminal for debugging analyses.

### Added

  `c_cpp_properties.json` file. These settings cascade to all analyzers,
  and are only set when no manual configuration of these two settings
  have taken place.

### Changed

- All of the linters will now perform an analysis according to their
  supported capabilities and the current `c-cpp-flylint.run` setting.

  Clang supports `onType` currently.

  activate due to missing binary or configuration file.
- Fixed a bug where the cascade of settings did not function as expected.

  detection logic. This has been resolved.
